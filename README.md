# Contributing

Before contributing to this repository please follow the following steps. Also please check [the contribution guidelines.](.github/contributing.md)

<br/>

## Step 1 - Check for any issue

Before making any changes, check to see if there are any issues describing the feature you want to add or the bug you want to fix.


### If there isn't an issue for the change you want to make, raise one

In the case that an issue doesn't exist for the change you want to make, raise one and fill in all the details asked for in the template.

<br/>

## Step 2 - Comment on the issue you want to pick up

When you have found an issue, comment on it requesting that you want to pick up the issue. If you have raised the issue, you can comment straight away saying you are going to resolve the issue yourself.

The reason for this is we have many people wanting to make certain changes, and we are running a first-come rota on who gets the issue. The first person to ask on an issue gets to resolve it.

<br/>

## Step 3 - On of the owners will comment and set to `in-progress`

If you can pick up an issue, the owners of the repository will comment saying so and set a `in-progress` label on the issue.

<br/>

## Extra Notes
---

## First come first served

We are managing the demand to contribute by allowing the first person to request addressing a change on an issue to be the person whose PR we will review.

Some issues can have multiple contributions, so please do ask on the issue if you can still contribute.

<br/>

## Please only pick up one issue at a time, and a maximum of two issues over October

There are many small changes available in the issues. This is to ensure there are plenty of issues available for different first time contributors to pick up.

Please don't address more than two issues in this repository. 

<br/>

## Please be patient

The maintainers look after this repository in their free time outside of full time jobs. They also have other priorities and commitments. We will try to address issues and pull requests in a timely manner, but sometimes it will take a few days. Please be patient.
