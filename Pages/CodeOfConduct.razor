			We believe that every single person has the right to take part in .NET Notts events
			and online communities in a safe and welcoming environment. Inclusivity is important to us.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			In order to avoid any situtations where an attendee may feel
			uncomfortable we ask that you not only treat others in the
			manner that you would expect to be treated, but also to
			respect what makes other people feel comfortable. As part of
			this we ask that speakers and representatives of the event try
			to refrain from language or actions that may be considered
			offensive.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or
			written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
			sexual behaviour, disability, physical appearance, body size,
			race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
			intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
			recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
			inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
			attention.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable,
			that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing
			it.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are
			expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, organisers,
			speakers, volunteers, and anyone else at any of
			our events or in our online communities are also subject to
			the anti-harassment policy. In particular, anyone involved should
			not use sexualised images, humour, activities, or other
			material in presentations, during events and on our online
			community.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, .NET Notts 
			may take any action .NET Notts deems
			appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
			the events and our online communities with no eligibility for
			reimbursement or refund of any type.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
			harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an
			organiser:
			</p><li tabindex="0"><a tabindex="0" href="mailto:pete@pjgcreations.co.uk" target="_blank">Email Pete</a> or contact him on the live chat or <a tabindex="0" href="https://twitter.com/dotnetnotts" target="_blank"> on the .NET Notts Twitter</a></li>

		<p tabindex="0">
			.NET Notts representatives will be happy to help
			participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
			provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
			harassment to feel safe while involved in our
			events and our online communities.
		</p>
		<p tabindex="0">
			For in person events The facilities provided at venues including
			networks, internet access, wifi, power supply, furniture,
			toilets and the physical environment in general, must be used
			with respect, in full accordance of the law, the terms of this
			document and any additional terms laid out at the event. When
			breaches of these terms take place .NET Notts may take
			any action they deem appropriate, including
			warning the offender, expulsion from the events and our online
			communities with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of
			any type, or even involving law enforcement.
