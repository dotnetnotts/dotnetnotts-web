                    We believe that every single person has the right to take part in .NET Notts events
                    and online communities in a safe and welcoming environment. Inclusivity is important to us.

                    In order to avoid any situtations where an attendee may feel
                    uncomfortable we ask that you not only treat others in the
                    manner that you would expect to be treated, but also to
                    respect what makes other people feel comfortable. As part of
                    this we ask that speakers and representatives of the event try
                    to refrain from language or actions that may be considered
                    offensive.

                    Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or
                    written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
                    sexual behaviour, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                    race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
                    intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
                    recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                    inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
                    attention.

                    If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable,
                    that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing
                    it.

                    our events or in our online communities are also subject to
                    the anti-harassment policy. In particular, anyone involved should
